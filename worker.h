///Creates event driven worker running in separate thread (or threads)
/**
 * Worker is a single thread or pool of multiple threads and single dispatcher. You can
 * dispatch various events to the worker's thread(s). These events are represented as functions
 * that are executed in context of the worker's thread.
 *
 * Worker object is allocated on heap and acts as shared resource. Once the worker is created, you
 * can transfer it through variables, pass it as value to the functions or to the lambda functions.
 * It cannot be copied, so it is always one instance shared at many places. The worker can
 * cleanup itself after the last reference is released. Also note, that enqueued functions
 * are also counted as references. This means you can enqueue a function and then discard the
 * refernce without worrying about destroying worker without processing the the function. The
 * worker deletes self once there is none of references and there is no work in its queue as well.
 *
 * To create worker, call Worker::create(), Then you can call dispatch() or use operator>>
 * to enqueue a work
 *
 * @code
 * auto worker = Worker::create();
 * worker.dispatch([=]{
 *    //function to execute in worker
 * })
 * @endcode
 *
 * The operator >> allows to combine worker with futures
 *
 * @code
 * auto worker = Worker::create()
 * worker >> [=]{
 	 	 int result = .. some calculation
 * 		return result;
 * } >> [=] (int res) {  //then
 *     //process result
 *
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can also use a worker to transfer processing chained code into worker's thread
 *
 * @code
 * auto worker = Worker::create();
 * doSomethingAsync() >> w >> [=](Result res) {
 *   //pick up the result res
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * The sequence >> w >> instructs the code to pass result to the worker and call the function
 * in the worker's thread, so the pick-up-result function will not block the thread
 * of the async operation.
 *
 *
 * Worker is created with single thread only. If you need to create multiple thread worker, you
 * need to specify count of threads as argument of the function create();
 *
 * @code
 * auto worker_8threads = Worker::create(8)
 * @endcode
 *
